I am enthusiastic about causal inference, probablistic machine learning, and time-series analysis. I am planning to pursue a PhD in 2023 and I am looking for any potential opportunities!

# Synthetic Control Method:

I am working on a generalized synthetic control method with state-space model under the direct guidance of [Dr. Linda Valeri](https://www.lindavaleri.com/), [Dr. Mingzhang Yin](https://mingzhang-yin.github.io/) and advices from[Dr. David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/).
We propose a generalized synthetic control method with time-varying weights based on state-space model (GSC-SSM), allowing for a more flexible and accurate construction of counterfactual series.

# Covariates Adaptive Design

Under the guidance of [Dr. Jingshen Wang](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/jingshenwang/), I have also conducted research in sequential randomization under a high-dimensional setting. We investigated the theoretical properties of statistical methods to achieve covariates balance for randomized clinical trials and proposed a new setting for Pairwise Sequential Randomization with many covariates. We further showed better efficiency of this sequential randomization.



# Other Research Experience

I was a visiting student in UCSD during my third academic year under the supervision of Prof. Mohit Jain and Dr. Tao Long, working on the topic of Integrative High-Throughput Metabolomics Analysis of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Phenotypes and Outcomes. Our paper:

Alotaibi, M., Shao, J., Pauciulo, M. W., Nichols, W. C., Hemnes, A. R., Malhotra, A., ... & Jain, M. (2022). Metabolomic Profiles Differentiate Scleroderma-PAH from Idiopathic PAH and Correspond with Worsened Functional Capacity. [CHEST](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2022.08.2230) 

In Peking University, I conducted my research on the topic of Image Based Age and Life Expectancy Prediction of C.elegans under Professor Jingdong Hanâ€™s supervision. In this project, I developed a deep learning model based on inception-ResNet-V2 for the image processing of microscopic pictures of Caenorhabditis elegans to predict their mortality and frailty.
