I am enthusiastic about causal inference, machine learning, and time-series analysis. I am planning to pursue a PhD in 2023 and I am looking for any potential opportunities!

# Synthetic Control Method:

I am working on a generalized synthetic control method with state-space model under the guidance of Professor Linda Valeri and Professor David Blei.

# Other Research Experience

I was a visiting student in UCSD during my third academic year under the supervision of Prof. Mohit Jain and Dr. Tao Long, working on the topic of Integrative High-Throughput Metabolomics Analysis of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Phenotypes and Outcomes. [Find one of the manual script here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/14/2021.07.10.21259355.full.pdf) It has been submitted to CHEST, under major revision.

In Peking University, I conducted my research on the topic of Image Based Age and Life Expectancy Prediction of C.elegans under Professor Jingdong Hanâ€™s supervision. In this project, I developed a deep learning model based on inception-ResNet-V2 for the image processing of microscopic pictures of Caenorhabditis elegans to predict their mortality and frailty.
