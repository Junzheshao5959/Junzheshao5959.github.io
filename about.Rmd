I am currently a first-year MS student in biostatistics at Columbia University, and I am enthusiastic about causal inference.
  
  
Before I have conducted various research projects spanning over biostatistics, bioinformatics, and biomedical research. I chose to be a visiting student in UCSD during my third academic year under the supervision of Prof. Mohit Jain and Dr. Tao Long, working on the topic of Integrative High-Throughput Metabolomics Analysis of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Phenotypes and Outcomes.

In Peking University, I conducted my research on the topic of Image Based Age and Life Expectancy Prediction of C.elegans under Professor Jingdong Hanâ€™s supervision. In this project, I developed a deep learning model based on inception-ResNet-V2 for the image processing of microscopic pictures of Caenorhabditis elegans to predict their mortality and frailty.
